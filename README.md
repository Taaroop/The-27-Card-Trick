# The-27-Card-Trick
# This is an explanation of my favorite mathematical card trick (which I first read about from 'Mathematics, Magic and Mystery' by Martin Gardner).
# I have also included a shorter (and much quicker algorithm) related to working in base 3, which is quite useful when actually performing the trick.
